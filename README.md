# vxace-gamejolt-script
a version of the rpg maker vx ace gamejolt script that doesn't have lagspikes when you have a lot of trophies.
i made this because i was playing hit fnafb fangame [tngau](https://gamejolt.com/games/touhou-nighter-grinder-and-uncut/90592) and i got really mad at the constant freezing.
probably hacky and bad i barely tested it but it seemed to work well enough
stuff affected is around award_trophy if you want to see
