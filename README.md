# vxace-gamejolt-script
a version of the rpg maker vx ace gamejolt script that doesn't have lagspikes when you have a lot of trophies (don't use this if your game doesn't have >100 trophies unless people have experienced lagspikes when getting the trophies you added last kthx)<br />
i made this because i was playing hit fnafb fangame [tngau](https://gamejolt.com/games/touhou-nighter-grinder-and-uncut/90592) and i got really mad at the constant freezing.<br />
probably hacky and bad i barely tested it but it seemed to work well enough<br />
stuff changed is around award_trophy if you want to see<br />
original script from [here](https://gamejolt.com/f/gamejolt-achievement-api-for-rpg-maker-vx-ace-beta/5070)<br />
note for checking if your game has said lagspikes: the lagspike gets more and more noticable the further down the trophy list the trophy is
